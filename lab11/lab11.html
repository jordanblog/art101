                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p> This lab challenged us to experiment with functions that take user input.
                        </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="minor-section">
                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p> There were some problems with getting the input text box to appear but we eventually 
                            got it to work. Overall this lab was pretty simple and similar to Lab 10. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p> This lab was straightforward and very similar to Lab 10. It was nice to get more
                            experience with buttons and functions since they will be so important for our final 
                            project. Overall, this lab was simple and a helpful follow up for Lab 10.

                        <p>The button produces an anagram of the entered username. </p>
