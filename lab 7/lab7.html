			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to experiment with JavaScript files and functions. 
                        In this lab we created functions that take user input and return the results.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was more complex for me than the previous labs. For the most part it was 
                        fairly straightforward however, I struggled at start as I tried to completely 
                        understand the terms and what exactly they do. Regardless, this lab was pretty
                        simple in the end and we were able to work out any issues we had within our code.  </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty simple, a bit more challenging than our other labs, but overall
                        it was pretty straightforward. I definitely feel more comfortable with JS, arrays, 
                        objects, and functions after this lab. </p>
