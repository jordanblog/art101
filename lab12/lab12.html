                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p> This lab challenged us to create a function that depends on conditionals. In this case, 
                            we created a function that sorted user input into one of the four Hogwarts houses.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p> This lab was pretty straightforward. I ran into minimal problems throughout the lab.
                            One small problem I encountered was with the usual missing semicolon and whitespace.
                            Overall, this lab was super simple because of the previous labs that dealt with buttons
                            and taking user input. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p> This lab was fun, it didn't feel too challenging but I still learned something knew and
                            applied my knowledge from previous labs. What I learned in this lab will be very helpful
                            for my group's final project! 
                        </p>
