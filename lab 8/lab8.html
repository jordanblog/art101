                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>This lab challenged us to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks 
                            in the web browser console and VScode .</p>
                </div>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>Although this lab was pretty simple and straightforward, it was more challenging
                           than our previous labs. This lab required more knowledge of JavaScript language
                           and challeneged me to really use what we learned in lecture about anon functions
                           and callbacks. The hardest part for me was actually starting the lab and deciding
                           what I wanted my function to be named and what I wanted it to calculate. Once I 
                           was set on those aspects of the lab the rest was pretty simple. </p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Overall, this lab was fun. It felt more intensive than the previous labs which was
                            a nice challenge. I feel more comfortable with JavaScript, functions, and callbacks
                            after completing this lab.
