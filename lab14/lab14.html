                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p> This lab challenged us to debug our previous JavaScript files that were not working or
                        had issues within our code. We were tasked with debugging our previous labs and fixing any 
                        problems we encountered with our code. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>  This lab was pretty simple, only one of my JavaScript files needed to be addressed due to typos
                        in my JavaScript file that VScode flagged. I also made some changes to my CSS file because it was 
                        not appearing on the page when opened through my GitHub link. 
                    </p>
            </div>

                <p>My Lab 8 JavaScript file had some typos within the code that needed to be addressed. 
                    Lines 18,20,23,25 had incorrect semicolons and missing commas. Other than these problems,
                the code seems to be working correctly. I also changed some minor CSS things that were not appearing 
                on my GitHub webpage when the Lab 8 link was clicked. </p>
