			<div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to add buttons to our html page 
                        using what we learned in lecture about JS and jQuery.
                    </p>
                    <button id="blue-button">Click Here</button>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was much more challenging for me than the previous labs!
                        I spent a lot of time examining my code and trying to find mistakes. 
                        For a big portion of this lab my buttons were not appearing on my 
                        html page. Once I found the problem, which was a missing '#' the buttons appeared.</p>
                        <button id="green-button">Click Here</button>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While this lab was frustrating I am glad that I was able to troubleshoot
                        and get my code working in the end. Overall, this lab was fun and a good
                        introduction to jQuery.
                    </p>
                    <button id="purple-button">Click Here</button>
