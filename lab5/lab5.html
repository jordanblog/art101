					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to create variables to
						hold data about our primary method of transportation
						in the JavaScript console on our broswer. Then in VScode
						we declared all the varibales we created in the console
						in the JavaScript File.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest problem was remembering to put a semicolon
						at the end of each line, but other than that this lab 
						was pretty straightforward.
					 </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a fun and simple introduction to JavaScript
						and the JavaScript console on the web browser. It combined
					what we learned about html and css with our new knowledge of JavaScript. </p>
