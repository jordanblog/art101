                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p> This lab challenged us to experiment with DOM manipulation. 
                            We created a Lab 10 index.html, css, and js folders in VScode. 
                            We created a button and assigned random text for the button to 
                            generate when clicked on. 
                        </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="minor-section">
                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p> Getting the button working was a bit hard. I eventually had to turn to 
                            Google to find different ways to make it work. At first, the button wasn't 
                            working at all. The text would appear when the page was refreshed rather than
                            when the button was clicked. After some modification I got the text to generate
                            when the button was clicked but it would generate as a list rather than replacing
                            the old generated text, this was when I turned to google for help. I was able to 
                            make the button functional and change the text.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Overall, this lab was fun! It was cool to play around with the button functions and
                            be a little more creative.

                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p> The button now generates a random color. </p>
