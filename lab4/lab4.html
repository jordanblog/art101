			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocode and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab challenged us to first pseudocode an everyday task.
						For our task we chose making coffee in a coffee maker. The 
						second tasked challenged us to pseudocode a computer game.
						We chose Rock Paper Scissors. We then turned our pseudocode
						for the game into JavaScript comments
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was pretty simple. At times it was challenging
						to list every single detail of the everyday task. One issue we 
						ran into was not knowing exactly how JavaScript works when it
						comes to coding games.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was straightforward, simple, and fun. Detailing the steps
						of making coffee in a coffee maker was honestly harder than expected, there
						are more steps to making coffee than we initially thought. Through completing 
						the tasks and working together, we put in the effort necessary to complete the 
						lab.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
						<p> How to Make Coffee in a Coffee Maker:
						<ul> 
							<li>Using the measurements on the side of the pot, fill the pot with the desired cups of water </li>
							<li>Pour the water from the pot into the back chamber of the coffee maker</li>
							<li>Place the pot back in the coffee maker</li>
							<li>Open the bag of coffee beans and pour the desired amounts of beans into the coffee grinder</li>
							<li>Set the grinder to the preferred grind setting  (medium-coarse is recommended for a coffee maker)</li>
							<li>Set the grinder’s volume measurement to the number of cups that corresponds with the amount of water filled in the pot</li>
							<li>Press the button that grinds the beans</li>
							<li>While the beans grind, line the permanent filter with a single-serve filter</li>
							<li>Once the beans are ground, remove the container from the grinder</li>
							<li>Pour the grinds into the lined filter</li>
							<li>Return the container to the grinder</li>
							<li>Close the lid of the coffee maker and press the “on” button</li>
							<li>Wait for the coffee to brew</li>
							<li>In the meantime, grab your favorite mug from the cabinet</li>
							<li>Once the coffee finishes, take the pot from the coffee maker and pour the coffee into the mug</li>
							<li>Drink the coffee</li>

						</ul>
