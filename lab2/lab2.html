        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>We are Sam and Jordan. Sam is a third year AGPM major and Jordan is a fourth year Politics major.
                We both have limited experience with coding but we are super excited to learn! Both of us love
                art and videogames and we are excited to see how this class engages with our shared interests!
