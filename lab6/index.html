					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challnenged us to use the web browser console
						and VScode to experiment with arrays and objects. We 
						used our knowledge from lecture to use console.log() and 
						document.writeln in our code.
						.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem I ran into was getting the format correct
						in the web browser console. I also had some problems 
					     remembering to include commas and semicolons in my code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was simple and fun. It was very similar to lab 5 so it was nice
						to have had some experience with JS already. I completed the lab with the 
					    necessary amount of effort to successfully complete each task. Overall,
					    this lab was straightforward and a fun introduction to arrays and objects. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p> This lab resulted in the created of an index.html file that shows
						my script output from my lab.js file and provides a summary of the 
						lab and my efforts.
