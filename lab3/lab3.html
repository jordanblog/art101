			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer. 
						This lab also created a homepage, introduction, and links to my labs for Art 101.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into some problems getting my css file to work, but most of my issues with
						css were punctuation problems like a lack of colons or semicolons. I also ran 
					into some issues publishing my homepage file to Github and getting the link to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fun. I enjoyed organizing my files and personalizing my homepage and introduction. 
						It was also cool to learn how to link pictures to my html. I put in a good amount of effort to complete 
					this lab. I went back through the lectures and closely read the instructions on canvas for each section of 
				the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> During this lab I edited my homepage by adding an introduction, a picture, and links to my labs
						for Art 101. I also created a file structure on my computer to maintain my files for this class.
